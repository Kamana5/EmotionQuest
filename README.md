# QHacks2025

This project was inspired by my little cousin, who has ASD and really struggles to understand emotions. It’s always been hard to see them feel left out in social situations because recognizing facial expressions doesn’t come naturally to them. I wanted to create something that could make a real difference—not just for them, but for other kids like them. That’s how the idea for this project was born: an interactive, fun way for kids to learn about facial features and emotions while practicing at their own pace.
